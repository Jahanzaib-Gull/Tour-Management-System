# (C++) Tour Management System Project! 🌍✈

I’m thrilled to share my console-based Tour Management System designed to streamline travel agency operations. This project was a deep dive into C++, file handling, and real-world problem-solving.

## 🚀 Key Features:
 ### ✅ Admin Panel:

🔹Add, view, sort (by price), and delete tours.
🔹Manage users and track bookings/feedback.

### ✅ Customer Portal:

🔹Category-based tour filtering (e.g., Adventure, Luxury).
🔹Price sorting (low-to-high & high-to-low).
🔹Book tours with auto-discounts (based on booking value).
🔹Submit and view feedback.

###✅ Data Persistence:

🔹All data (tours, users, bookings) saved in files.

##🛠 Tech Stack:
C++ (File I/O, Control Structures)
